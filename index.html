        <section class=".section">
          <P>
            The Lake Overholser Bridge in Oklahoma City is a proud reminder of
            Route 66. During the early 1920s, automobiles were replacing horses
            and buggies on Oklahoma roads which, at that time, were not part of
            an organized system but were instead an assortment of poorly
            maintained lanes connecting rural villages to county seats.
            Navigating from one part of Oklahoma to another was not always easy.
            The development of a State highway system and the coming of Route 66
            changed all that.</P
          >
          <p>
            In 1924, the State Highway Commission made a bold move. The
            commission published a State road map showing Oklahoma’s 5,000 miles
            of road and labeling them as highways identified by numbers 1 to 26.
            The map described each State highway by the towns through which it
            passed. The commission also determined that each highway was to be
            marked by a sufficient number of official State highway signs, in
            the center of which would be a figure denoting the number of the
            highway.

          <h3>New Construction begins</h3>
          <p>
            One of these new State highways was old Highway 3, which ran east
            and west from Fort Smith, Arkansas, to Texola on the Texas border
            over a different route than today’s Highway 3. Known also as the
            Postal Road, Highway 3 was a primary corridor stretching across
            Oklahoma, but very little of it had pavement. What little pavement
            there was on Highway 3 washed away along with every bridge in the
            Oklahoma City area during the massive floods of 1923. For two years,
            traffic on the Postal Road had to use a ferry to cross the Canadian
            River where it emptied into Oklahoma’s water reservoir, the
            Overholser Lake.
          </p>
          <p>
            The need for a new bridge was obvious. Construction of the
            Overholser Bridge began in 1924 and the bridge opened for traffic in
            August of 1925. Accommodating a wide bed of 20 feet for traffic, the
            Overholser was no ordinary bridge. The engineers who designed it not
            only used the new steel truss technology, but also combined a
            variety of trusses in unusual ways. With both Parker through trusses
            and pony trusses, the 748-foot bridge is not only an unusual design,
            but a balanced and elegant one. The Bridge was no sooner finished
            than its status began to change. The local press reported that the
            old Highway 3 was being considered as part of one of the routes to
            be designated a U.S. Highway.When the path of Route 66 was announced
            the next year, Highway 3 was part of the plan. When Route 66 left
            Oklahoma City, it carried travelers over the Lake Overholser Bridge.

            For more than three decades the bridge served as a critical link for
            motorists traveling across the State and country. Some were
            vacationers, others crossed this bridge with hopes of finding better
            lives further west, and others were part of the trucking industry
            which was rapidly replacing rail transport. The volume was
            tremendous. By the 1950s, the bridge could not sustain this level of
            constant traffic. Heavily chromed cars with shapely fins had to sit
            too long at the bottleneck the bridge had become. In 1958, the
            Federal Government took action, replacing this segment of Route 66
            with a new four-lane divided highway just to the north. The new
            section included a wider bridge, while local traffic continued to
            pass over the Lake Overholser Bridge.

          <p>
            Today it carries only local traffic, yet the symmetry and size of
            the old bridge still catch the eye of drivers speeding by on the
            more recent replacement lanes just north of the bridge. Officially,
            the Overholser Bridge lost its association with Route 66 in 1958,
            but its size and symmetry and long-time service as part of old Route
            66, make it a landmark today for anyone traveling America’s Mother
            Road. The bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic
            Places in 2004.
